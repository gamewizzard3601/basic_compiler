This project is about learning how simple compilers work.
Takes in a basic-like language as imput and compiles it into c code.
Basic source code will go through a lexer to be broken into tokens, then goes through a parser which creates the program tree, then the emitter which outputs the compiled c code.
**Not currently in functional state!!
